introduction

this is a simplified outline of our bioinformatics pipeline
for those not familiar with bioinformatics pipelines, they're a smattering of tools, called in sequence to scrub and analyze the data
reads walk through this entire process, starting off with initial cleaning
we remove low quality reads, remove host contamininents, and vectors
then we remove rRNA

and we start the analysis.

performance-wise, it's a slow process, bounded by the size of your data.
